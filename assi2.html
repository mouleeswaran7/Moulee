    <h3> <a name="chap1">Communication Technology:</a></h2>
    <img src="assignment2/communi.png" alt=""align="center" >
            <p>Communication is indeed rather essential in all aspects of our personal and professional life to express emotions, share information, exchange ideas and what not.
 Communication technology is probably one of the most common technologies being vastly used in our everyday life. Advancement in technology has enhanced the ways to communicate information from one place to another.
 It helps us to communicate with each other with more convenience, in less time, and with greater accuracy.</p>
<p> Communication technology helps in transmitting data or information by using various devices like telephone, radio, television, and the internet. Businesses also utilize communication technology for facilitating the flow of knowledge and information in workplaces, promoting innovative services or products, serving consumers requests and needs, and in their decision making processes.

<h4> <a name="chap2">Construction Technology:</a></h4>
<img src="assignment2/construction.png" alt="">
       <p>Construction technology is related to the equipment and methods utilized to build both advanced and basic buildings and structures.
 This can include heavy engineering structures like bridges. The methods of construction use different heavy machinery and tools like tractors for land preparation, computer software to design and create a digitalized version of the building or structure. These construction tools help in enhancing the operational efficiency and ensuring that the builders complete the project with minimum issues and accidents, within the specified budget and within the given deadline.

<h4> <a name="chap3">Product Technology:</a></h4>
<img src="assignment2/product.jpg" alt="">
<p>Product technology is the understanding of specifications and characteristics of a service or product created as per the needs of the market and manufacturing processes.
 It is the specific technology used by the manufacturer of the service or product, its manpower, standards, materials, design specifications, procedures and methods.</p><p>
 It helps in determining the functional characteristics, properties, and structure of the product to ensure it meets the requirements and needs of the customer.</p><hr>
 <h4> <a name="chap4">Architecture Technology</a></h4>
 <img src="assignment2/architecture.png" alt="">
 <p>This type of technology is the application of modern technology for designing buildings. Architecture technology is the component of building and architecture engineering and is often referred to as its sub-category or distinct discipline.
 New technologies and materials generated new construction methods and design challenges throughout the buildingâ€™s evolution, more specifically since the emergence of industrialization in the 19th century.
 Architecture technology spans engineering, building science, and architecture and is practiced by building/architectural engineers, structural engineers, architectural technologists, and architects, as well as others developing concept or design in buildable reality. It helps with various elements of buildings, including smart windows and elevators.

<h4> <a name="chap5">Business Technology:</a></h4>
<img src="assignment2/business.jpg" alt="">
<p>Business technology is the application of information, engineering, data and science for businesses related purposes like achieving organizational and economic goals. This technology helps in the proper and systematic running of businesses and for enhancing different business functions and operations. This typically includes a mixture of hardware and software.
Small businesses utilize technology to establish innovative ways of competing with established businesses and to generate new leads.</p><p> Technology helps even home businesses to be perceived as a big company which helps that business to gain a competitive position in the market.
 What exactly is business technology? It is a tech which is integrated into the business operation directly. For instance, a television in a living room is not a business technology but a streaming channel developed by a company to distribute engaging content to the audience is definitely business technology. The difference between other technologies and business technology is the business integration; a technology device present in your business and a technology device being actively involved in your business are two different things, the latter being a part of business technology.
